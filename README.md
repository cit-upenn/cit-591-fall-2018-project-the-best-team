The UltimateFlightAssitant is a handy tool for air travel.

The program has four functions, each accessible in a tab. The first one is getting the travel time/distance from the traveller's current location to the airport. There are three travel modes, namely driving, walking and bicycling available.
The second function is flight status check. It takes in the airport IATA code, the flight ICAO code and flight type (departure or arrival) as input and returns the flight status. It can also tell the user if precheck is required at the specified airport.
The third function gives handy information of the destination city, such as local time and weather.
The fourth function uses the google places API to retriece places of specific type that is near the user. It takes the user's current address, range in ft as well as the type of the places as input. The program can find atm, transit stations, lodgingings, etc and retrieve the name, address and user rating.
